# Genetic-Algorithms
Code that implements a Genetic Algorithm regression approach in Mathematica. Version 11.2+ recommended.

Comments:

1. Run the Genetic Algorithm (GA) code with different grammars, adjust the crossover and mutation rates.
2. Can run with both uncorrelated and correlated data by changing the likelihood.
3. Error estimates using the path-integral approach.
4. Operative in one dimension but can be easily extended in more dimensions.

If you use this code, please cite the papers arXiv: 2002.12700, 2001.11420, 1910.01529
